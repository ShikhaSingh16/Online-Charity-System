        <p>LITTLE HEROS is a flagship program run and administrated by GIFTS FOUNDATION INDIA specially designed for help the neediest children with medical aid and support and beyond.

Not neglecting the fact that India is the second largest populated country in the world and also a nation with more than 50% of its population below the poverty line.

India as a country acknowledges the fact and as a developing country is trying very hard to better its future and curb these numbers but with the growing demand and inadequate supply, India has a lot room at the global front to improve.</p>
